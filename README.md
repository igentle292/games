# games
These are all assorted game projects I made on my own time to test my abilities. I have also explored making GUIs for each of these games to create a better experience
sudokuGenerator: Uses sudokuSolver to generate a filled sudoku puzzle, and randomly removes values from the puzzle as long as one unique solution is available
sudokuPlayer: Uses sudokuGenerator to create a solvable puzzle, and allows the user to play it through the console. Also features a timer, and warns of errors if the puzzle was solved incorrectly
sudokuSolver: Uses a guess and check method to solve a sudoku puzzle
swingTicTacToe: A graphical implementation of tic-tac-toe using javax.swing
ticTacToe: An implementation of tic-tac-toe that can be played in the console(yes I did hardcode the win conditions, dont judge me too hard)

visualTicTacToe: A graphical implementation of tic-tac-toe using java.awt
